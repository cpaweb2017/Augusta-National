							I don’t normally bother to email but thought it worth it on this occasion. The trip to the Masters was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The hotel was great and picking up the tickets was as easy as you described. The only negative was the trip was too short. Will definitely use you again for a return trip next year.

							Lewis. Our trip to the Masters was spot on and great value. The Hotel Hilton was as described and the staff could not do enough for us. The trip to Augusta national was an hour from Columbia but very straightforward. The golf you booked for us was great and the courses were in top condition. Really enjoyable trip and very well organised. Cheers

							The Masters was the best golfing experience ever. I have been to the Monaco Grand Prix and Wimbledon final, but this topped them both. Trip was perfectly arranged the only issue I had was that I didn’t buy tickets for more days!

							My wife and I had a simply fantastic trip to watch The Masters. It is a wonderful place to watch golf with small and polite patrons following the world's top players. Our trip was made all the more special by adding on a few days at Sawgrass after which was all arranged by Augusta Golf Travel

							Lewis, having just returned from Augusta I would like to thank you and your team at Augusta Golf Travel for a stress-free trip. Everything was organised for us and we had a fabulous time. The golf course was awesome and every thing I expected it to be from watching it on Tele over the years. Your price was better than others I had and will use you again for future golf trips.
